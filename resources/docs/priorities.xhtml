    <h1>IMS Priorities</h1>

    <p>
      The Ranger IMS associates a priority level with each incident.
      This can provide a way to identify incidents that need greater attention or can be safely ignored for a while, which may be useful for managing Operator and Khaki workload when there are many open incidents to manage.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order for priorities to be useful, however, it's important that they be used consistantly.
      To that end, the list below itemizes the priority levels and how they should be utilized:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <dl>
        <dt>High</dt>
        <dd>We need to deal with this ASAP.</dd>
        <dt>Normal</dt>
        <dd>Default priority.  Handle this as soon as resources allow.</dd>
        <dt>Low</dt>
        <dd>This is not resolved, but does not need attention right now.</dd>
      </dl>
    </blockquote>
