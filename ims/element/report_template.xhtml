        Please stick to facts.
        Do not write about what you think may have happened; just write about what you did, saw and heard yourself.
        Do include things that people told you, but be sure to note who said what.
        It is important to distinguish what you are saying from what you heard others say.

        Write everything you can remember, in as much detail as possible.
        Don't worry about your report being too long, but be clear and concise.
        Avoid jargon and acronyms.
      </p>
